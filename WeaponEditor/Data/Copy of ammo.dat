.50 AE Spyder Frangible Rounds
The Spyder is a specially-crafted high-frangibility ammunition designed to open upon impact with targets. The rhombical pattern achieved upon opening behaves much like an arrowhead, preventing extraction and causing large open wounds. As a consequence, the energy transmission and AP Level of this ammunition is low.
