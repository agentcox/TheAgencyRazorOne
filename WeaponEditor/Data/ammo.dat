K-Round
Kierson N-Limit Rounds
This unique ammo was developed by Chance Kierson, a ballistics engineer working out of Langley's CIA S&T team. The K-Rounds, as they are called, have a unique capability to punch targets with high energy blasts, and inflict latent damage beneath the surface. In this way, the K-Rounds can be used as a knockdown-latent round for special situations.
