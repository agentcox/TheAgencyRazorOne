F-05
F-05 Reflex .50 Caliber Pistol
#
The F-05 Reflex is an incredible blend of speed and power. A .50 caliber, AE chambered pistol, the Reflex is DSA's standard heavy assault pistol. The .50 caliber slugs can tear through most armor easily, and the 7-round clip can store enough power to drop an assault team. Due to the high flash and concussion capacity, however, this gun can only accept a laser sight modification.

KL-05
KL-05 Gyroscopic Sniper Rifle
#
A sniper's dream; the KL-05 was developed jointly by DSA and Reliable Systems in Virginia. The key factor in the KL-05's excellent sniping ability is the gyroscopic unit that helps to stabilize the rifle for long-range shooting. The KL-05 utilizes a magazine system that can hold up to five rounds at a time.
