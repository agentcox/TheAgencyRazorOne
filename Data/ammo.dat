ShockTox
ShockToxin Rounds
A DSA innovation, ShockToxin rounds use a binary capsule system in the nose of the bullet that holds a toxic mixture of Trilithium Sulfate and Hydroflouric Acid. When the bullet expands upon contact, the binary system breaks open; the chemicals are mixed, and the resulting reaction forces a small chemical explosion, spraying acidic remnants inside the wound channel.

Ring Expansion Rounds
Taking their ideas from modern air-to-air missiles, the DSA team responsible for Ring Rounds created a lethal package. The ring rounds enter a target, and upon expansion, tensile rings pop open within the wound cavity at predetermined intervals, further spreading the wound channel and bracing it open. This type of round does have a drawback, in that the ring rounds can expand within armor to no effect, should the target have armor.
